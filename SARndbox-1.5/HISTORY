The Augmented Reality Sandbox History
=====================================

SARndbox-1.0:
- Initial release, needs Vrui-2.4 to build.

SARndbox-1.1:
- Added constant water evaporation rate to sandbox.

SARndbox-1.2:
- Adapted code to APIs of Vrui-2.7 and Kinect-2.5.
- Changed types of all size variables to unsigned int.

SARndbox-1.3:
- Fixed projector calibration code.
  - Fixed normalization of calibration homography.
  - Fixed calculation of projected z value for z buffering.
  - Now properly handles non-orthogonal Kinect views.

SARndbox-1.4:
- Bumped Vrui version requirement to Vrui-3.0-001.
- Bumped Kinect version requirement to Kinect-2.7.
- Fixed a mistake in step 5 of the installation instructions in the
  README file; measurement points must be taken in zig-zag order, not
  counter-clockwise. It's still wrong in the calibration video.
- Updated instructions in README file according to new calibration
  utility.

SARndbox-1.5:
- Made non-target blobs yellow in CalibrateProjector to make it easier
  to distinguish the target blob (green).
